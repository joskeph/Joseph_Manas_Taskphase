Greetings everyone!

We hope your mid semester exams went well. 

The end of your exams marks the start of the first task of your taskphase. Attached below are your tasks, submission guidelines and the learning material for your task.

To make your submissions, please upload a ZIP file of the folder named "Task 1." Within this folder, include all tasks organised in separate subfolders named according to their specific domains. Submit your zip files to manasmgmtinterview@gmail.com. Mention your name and the task number. (eg, Astin_Task1) As the subject of the mail while submitting.

Usage of any AI tools is strictly prohibited.

Deadline for this Task is 4th October 2025

We advise you start soon and slowly progress throughout the weeks, instead of starting later and rushing through the tasks, because we expect proper high quality submissions. This will also prevent you from considering the tasks as a burden.

We have created a general discussion group as well, where u can ask any doubts regarding the tasks.
